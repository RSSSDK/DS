Applied Data science Capstone Project 

Business Understanding 

Because of the increase in the number of cars and the raise of accidents happened in the roads too, this cause injuries or fatalities to people, waste time and cost for police and rescue vehicles, traffic delay in the area. 

The Seattle Department of Transportation (SODT) objective to improve new model aims to predict the severity of car accidents and main variables that strongly related to it, in order to help decisions based to make campaigns or improvements to decrease severe accidents based on certain conditions. 

 
Data Understanding 

In this phase, I will use csv file provided by Coursera. The main attributes I will use as independent variables are: WEATHER, Speeding, FATALITIES, ROADCOND, LIGHTCOND and the Day (INCDTTM), that adequate to train my machine learning model. Also, I will assess the condition of these attributes by looking for skewed information and the correlations between them and the severity of the accident. 

Data preparation 

In this phase I will build the final dataset that fed my model by: 

Filling missing data  

Perform one hot-encoding for codec data  

Derive new features like Day in a week. 

Finally, balance and normalize all data.
